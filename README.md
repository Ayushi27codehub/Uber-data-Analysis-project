🚖 Uber Data Analysis
📌 Description
This project presents an exploratory analysis of Uber trip data to uncover ride patterns, mileage trends, and demand fluctuations. Using Python’s data science stack, the dataset is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to highlight how Uber rides vary across time of day, monthly distribution, and distance traveled (MILES).
The analysis demonstrates practical applications of data wrangling, visualization, and statistical exploration. Insights gained can help optimize ride allocation, identify unusual ride behaviors, and improve customer experience.

🔍 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw Uber trip data.
- Explore ride distributions by day vs. night and monthly demand.
- Visualize mileage trends using count plots, box plots, and histograms.
- Detect outliers and anomalies in ride distances.
- Summarize maximum mileage per month using groupby operations.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas – data manipulation
- NumPy – numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

📊 Key Insights
- Short-distance trips dominate Uber usage, but long-distance rides show seasonal variations.
- Peak demand occurs during specific hours and months.
- Outliers in mileage data may represent airport or intercity rides.
- Filtering subsets (e.g., MILES < 40) helps highlight specific ride behaviors.
